### Hey There Friends I'm Mason 

## About Me
- I'm a Math Nerd who enjoys tackle difficult problems and playing TTRPGs with my friends
- I've been working in the tech industry for about 8 years now first as Tech Support then as QA for a Software Testing Company 
- I'm currently working towards transitioning into a career centered on development particularly in regards to Data Science but I'm always open to learning new things and challenging myself 

[Bloomtech](https://www.bloomtech.com/) has afforded me the opportunity to learn a variety of useful skils including Predictive Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Neural Networks using programming languages such as Python and SQL and tools/libraries like Tensorflow, scikit learn, and pandas.
